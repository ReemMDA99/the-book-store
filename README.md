# the-book-store

A fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. 

## User Stories

`AS AN avid reader
I WANT to search for new books to read
SO THAT I can keep a list of books to purchase`


## Acceptance Criteria

- Set up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, replacing the existing RESTful API.

- Modify the existing authentication middleware so that it works in the context of a GraphQL API.

- Use Apollo Client to create an Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server.

- Deploy the application to Heroku using a MongoDB database hosted at MongoDB Atlas.
